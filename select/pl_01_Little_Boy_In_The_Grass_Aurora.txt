I will tell you the story
About the little boy I found in
the grass
Tired, solace, he told me
He could hear the children
wanting to pass
Sounds of laughter in the air
Still today we hear them
Finally we are over it, oh
Finally we are over, over it oh
(Let them run)
Let them run from the violence
The world is way too cold and
bright for their eyes
Little boy runs beside them
As they take his hands and jump
to the sky
Still today you hear them
Finally I am over it, over it oh
Finally I am over, over it oh
When will my healing come?
When will my healing come along?
Sinking like a stone
When will my healing come along?
Finally I am over it, oh
Finally I am over it, oh
Finally I am, am...
