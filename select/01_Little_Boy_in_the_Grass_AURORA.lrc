[00:10.18] I will tell you the story
[00:13.28] About the little boy I found in the grass
[00:18.86] Tired soul as he told me
[00:22.23] He could hear the children wanting to pass
[00:43.23] 
[00:27.63] Sounds of laughter in the air
[00:36.24] Still today we hear them
[00:48.24] 
[00:42.87] Finally, we are over it all

[02:41.48] Finally, I am over it all
[02:50.24] Finally, I am over it all
[03:02.74] 
[02:58.27] Ha-ooh-ah, ah-ha
[03:06.97] Ha-ooh-ah, ah-ha
[03:15.78] Ha-ooh-ah, ah-ha
