I will tell you the story
About the little boy I found in the grass
Tired soul as he told me
He could hear the children wanting to pass

Sounds of laughter in the air
Still today we hear them

Finally, we are over it all
Finally, we are over, over it all

(Let them run)
Let them run from the violence
The world is way too cold and bright for their eyes
Little boy runs beside them
As they take his hand and jump to the sky

Still today you hear him

Finally, I am over, over it all
Finally, I am over, over it all

Ha-ooh-ah, ah-ha
Ha-ooh-ah, ah-ha

When will my healing come?
When will my healing come along?
Sinking like a stone
When will my healing come along?

Finally, I am over it all
Finally, I am over it all

Ha-ooh-ah, ah-ha
Ha-ooh-ah, ah-ha
Ha-ooh-ah, ah-ha
Ha-ooh-ah, ah-ha
Finally, I am...
